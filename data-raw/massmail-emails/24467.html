                <div style="min-height:360px;line-height:16px;"> I am pleased to report that the results of the University-wide Climate Survey of the University of Illinois are now available at <a href="http://www.uillinois.edu/climatesurvey/">http://www.uillinois.edu/climatesurvey/</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/><br/>The primary finding of the survey is that faculty, students and staff generally have a positive perception of overall climate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the University the mean ratings of faculty, students and staff are 3.5, 3.7, and 3.4 respectively, on a scale where 1 is least favorable and 5 is most favorable.&nbsp;&nbsp;For faculty and staff the most important component in explaining differences in ratings is a grouping of questions we named Professional Work Environment; for students, Social Environment and Integration.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>I also direct you to the executive summary and the reports published on the website for a rich snapshot of our University climate.&nbsp;&nbsp; The staff of the UIC Survey Research Laboratory continues to analyze and synthesize the over 17,000 survey responses, and the website will be updated as more findings are available.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>The purpose of the University-wide Climate Survey was to assess the perceptions relating to the campus, workplace, and academic environment and we were successful in that endeavor for a first-time effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have learned that though the climate is rated generally positive, there are areas the three campuses and the University Administration should review.&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end, a cross-campus committee is being named to coordinate the campuses&#39; responses to the findings. <br/><br/>I extend my appreciation to the many who participated in the survey, those who worked to analyze the findings, and all who will undertake a study of the results.&nbsp;&nbsp;The University is committed to improving climate where improvement is needed, striving for a positive environment for all its students and its employees. <br/><br/>Christophe Pierre<br/>Vice President for Academic Affairs<br/>University of Illinois<br/><br/>377 Henry Administration Building<br/>506 South Wright Street<br/>Urbana, IL&nbsp;&nbsp;61801 </div>
