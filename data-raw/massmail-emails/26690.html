                <div style="min-height:360px;line-height:18px;"> Dear Colleagues,<br/><br/>The University of Illinois Foundation this morning announced the appointment of seasoned fundraising executive Thomas J. Farrell as its new president and chief executive officer, effective Jan. 1, 2013. The UIF board and its chair, U of I alumna Jane P. Donaldson, have chosen in Tom a dynamic leader with a record of accomplishment in development and alumni relations at several&nbsp;&nbsp;top-tier universities during the last two decades.<br/><br/>Tom Farrell is the former vice president for alumni relations and development at the University of Chicago.&nbsp;&nbsp;His career also includes success at the University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, the University at Buffalo School of Law, and the University of Rochester, from which he also earned his bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees. He earned a doctorate in higher education management from the University of Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>The partnership between the University of Illinois and the Foundation is more important than ever as philanthropy and private giving plays an increasingly critical role in providing the resources required to ensure excellence. The chancellors and I look forward to working with Tom, the UIF staff and board, as well as their counterparts at the Alumni Association, as we strengthen the University of Illinois&#39; position as one of the best universities in the world.<br/><br/>Dr. Farrell succeeds our long-time friend and colleague Sid Micek as president and CEO at the Foundation. We commend Sid on his exceptional service to the Foundation and University during the last 13 years and look forward to his continued support of the University.<br/><br/>Please join me in welcoming Tom Farrell to the University of Illinois family.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Bob Easter <br/>President<br/>University of Illinois<br/><br/><br/>More information:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.uif.uillinois.edu">http://www.uif.uillinois.edu</a>/ </div>
