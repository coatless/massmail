                <div style="min-height:360px;line-height:18px;"> INCIDENT: Three Arrests in Campus Battery<br/><br/>OCCURRED: September 30, 2012<br/><br/>LOCATION:300 E. Springfield Avenue, Champaign<br/><br/>The Champaign Police has relesased the following information:<br/><br/>Over the weekend, Champaign Police responded to four reports of batteries and thefts that appear to be related.&nbsp;&nbsp;The victims in these incidents reported being &quot;punched&quot; in the head by someone in a group as they were walking down the sidewalk.&nbsp;&nbsp;The victims reported that the offenders were among a group of three males and three females.&nbsp;&nbsp;These incidents occurred after curfew, between 1:30 a.m. and 3:22 a.m., and in the areas of 500 E. Healey, 700 S. Sixth, 300 E. Springfield, and 200 E. John.<br/><br/>During one of the incidents, which occurred on September 30th, in the 300 block of E. Springfield Avenue, a 19 year-old women&#39;s cell phone was taken after she was punched by an unknown female.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two females, ages 15 and 16, and a 16 year-old male were later located and arrested for this one incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, based on the witness statements it is believed this group may be responsible for all four incidents.<br/><br/>The Champaign Police is concerned that these incidents are similar to a recent phenomenon circulating on the internet called &quot;Point them out, knock them out&quot;. Simply stated, the offending group identifies an unsuspecting victim and one of the offenders punches the victim in the head then flees the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Champaign Police Department has been investigating five similar random incidents on campus over the past few weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, this weekend&#39;s events are clearly a spike in this type of activity.<br/><br/>In an effort to deter this activity, the Champaign Police will be providing additional officers on campus to address the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;The University of Illinois Police will also be assisting to addressing these behaviors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers will be aggressively enforcing curfew violations and making contact with subjects on campus who appear to be violating the curfew ordinance.<br/>Officers encourage pedestrians in the campus area to be aware of their surroundings at times and officer the following tips to avoid being victimized.<br/><br/>- Walk in groups and use well-lighted routes, wherever possible.<br/>- Avoid walking near groups of loitering juveniles and/or non-college age individuals.<br/>- Report to police any confrontations and/or threats from groups of juveniles and/or non-college age individuals.<br/>- Be aware of your surroundings and do not be distracted by your cell phone or mp3 player.<br/>- If you drink, please be responsible for yourself and look out for your friends who may be intoxicated.<br/><br/>The Champaign Police Department encourages parents to ensure their children do not violate the City&#39;s curfew ordinance, which carries a fine of $175.<br/><br/>Sec. 23-211. - Curfew establishes; hours; exceptions; enforcement:<br/>a. No person thirteen (13) years of age or younger shall be or remain upon any street, alley, or other public place in the City&nbsp;&nbsp;between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.<br/>b.No person between the ages of fourteen (14) through sixteen (16), inclusive, shall be on any street, alley or other public place in the City between the hours of 11:00 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, inclusive, and 6:00 a.m. the following day, or between the hours of 12:01 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday.<br/><br/>The Champaign and University of Illinois Police Departments are actively working to identify and apprehend the offenders in these incidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone with information is asked to call Champaign Police at 217-351-4545 or callers can remain anonymous by calling Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (TIPS).&nbsp;&nbsp;Tips can also be submitted through www.373tips.com or text by sending CCTIP plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES).<br/><br/>Jeffrey T.
