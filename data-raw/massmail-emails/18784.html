                <div style="min-height:360px;line-height:16px;"> This e-mail message applies to students who are or have been employees of the University of Illinois during tax year 2011. If you were NOT an employee during tax year 2011, please disregard this message.<br/><br/>If you are a Foreign National student (nonresident alien) who is or has been a University employee during tax year 2011, you may NOT receive your 1042-S tax form electronically. Your tax Form 1042-S will be mailed to you as in previous years. However, there is an important mailing address requirement that also applies to you. Please refer to section 3 (Address Requirement for Mailing of Forms).<br/><br/>*********************************************<br/>Below is important information that will help you with end-of-year processing of the Statement of Wages (IRS Form W-2).<br/><br/>1. Electronic process for Form W-2 <br/>2. Consent process for electronic access<br/>3. Address requirement for mailing of forms<br/>4. Where to find additional information<br/><br/>=============================================<br/>1. ELECTRONIC PROCESS FOR FORM W-2<br/>=============================================<br/><br/>Again this year the University is pleased to offer the option of accessing your Form W-2 electronically. Last year over 39,850 employees chose to receive their W-2 electronically. The consent process for calendar year 2011 is open through January 16, 2012 @ 10:59 P.M.<br/>If You Previously Consented:<br/><br/>You do not need to provide consent again this year to retrieve your 2011 Form W-2 electronically if you previously consented. You will receive a notification from University Payroll during the second week of January, indicating that your Form W-2 is available online and giving you instructions on how to access it.<br/><br/>If You Are a Foreign National (Non-Resident Alien) Employee:<br/><br/>The electronic option is NOT available for Form 1042-S for Foreign National employees. Foreign Nationals will receive their tax form in the mail as in previous years. Please note an important requirement below in section 3 (Address Requirement for Mailing of Forms).<br/><br/>If You Wish to Receive Your W-2 Electronically:<br/><br/>If you have not previously agreed to have your information sent electronically, you can provide consent at any time through January 16, 2012 @ 10:59 P.M. See section 2 (Consent Process for Electronic Access) below for details.<br/><br/>If you DO NOT consent to receive your W-2 electronically by January 16, 2012 @ 10:59 P.M., you will receive a printed Form W-2 by regular mail.<br/><br/>Benefits of accessing your Form W-2 online include:<br/><br/>*You will have access to your Form W-2 at least two weeks earlier than the distribution of mailed copies.<br/>*Your Form W-2 is always available to you for secure, convenient and timely access.<br/>*Because you are retrieving your Form W-2 electronically from a secured Web site, you need not worry that&nbsp;&nbsp;the form will be lost in the mail or stolen from your mailbox and used for identity theft.<br/>*Duplicates are just a few clicks away, even as late as April 14 or 15. <br/><br/>=============================================<br/>2. CONSENT PROCESS FOR ELECTRONIC ACCESS<br/> =============================================<br/><br/>If you wish to receive your Form W-2 electronically, you must provide consent using the NESSIE application through January 16, 2012 @ 10:59 P.M., by following the steps below:<br/><br/>1.

Follow the instructions at the bottom of the form to provide consent: <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Enter the consent code (Click on link to retrieve the code.

ADDRESS REQUIREMENT FOR MAILING OF FORMS <br/>=============================================<br/><br/>The University of Illinois contracts the services of JAT Software for the annual mailing of Form W-2 and Form 1042-S (for Foreign Nationals).<br/><br/>Form W-2 and Form 1042-S will be mailed to the &quot;mailing address&quot; listed on the employee&#39;s Personal Information tab in NESSIE as of December 31, 2011.
