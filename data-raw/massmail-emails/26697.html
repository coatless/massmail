Orchard Street, Urbana<br/><br/>BRIEF DETAILS:<br/><br/>The University of Illinois Police Department is investigating a Robbery that occurred near 1961 S. Orchard Street, Urbana (Orchard Downs).<br/><br/>On October 24, 2012, at approximately 12:00 AM the victim was walking in the 1900 block of South Orchard Street.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the victim crossed to the east side of Orchard Street, he observed two offenders, coming from the south, riding bicycles.&nbsp;&nbsp;The offenders approached him, and one asked to borrow the victim&#39;s cell phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the victim handed Offender 1 his cell phone he was struck, from behind, by Offender 2. The victim was then struck several more times.&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim gave the offenders his property, and both fled the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:<br/><br/>Offender 1 is described as a male, 5&#39;10&quot; tall, skinny build. This offender was wearing a dark hoodie and dark pants. <br/><br/>Offender 2 is described as a male, wearing dark clothing.<br/><br/>Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing or unusual characteristics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Racial descriptions do not, by themselves, offer a meaningful picture of an individual&#39;s appearance. <br/><br/>POLICE RESPONSE:<br/><br/>The University of Illinois continues to actively work to identify and apprehend the offenders in this incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;Witnesses to this event or those with information are encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216.<br/><br/>SAFETY INFORMATION:<br/><br/>Members of the campus community are strongly encouraged to follow these safety tips to decrease their potential for becoming a victim:<br/><br/>-Stay alert - call the police immediately to report suspicious activity and/or if this subject is observed.<br/><br/>-Trust your instincts - if it does not feel right, call for help.<br/><br/>-Avoid walking alone at night. Travel in groups when possible and always walk in well-lit, heavily traveled areas. <br/><br/>-Turn down your electronic devices. Excessive volume or use of electronic devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones, etc.) can distract you from potential safety hazards.<br/><br/>-If you choose to consume alcohol, please drink moderately - remember your ability to respond is diminished by over-consumption of alcohol.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:<br/><br/>The University of Illinois, Champaign and Urbana Police Departments are collaborating to provide CrimeReports, a national crime mapping service, with up-to-date crime information.
