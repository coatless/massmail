                <div style="min-height:360px;line-height:18px;"> INCIDENT:&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexual Assault <br/> <br/>OCCURRED:&nbsp;&nbsp; October 28, 2012 at approximately 3:00 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>LOCATION:&nbsp;&nbsp; 202 East Green Street, Champaign<br/><br/>BRIEF DETAILS:<br/><br/>The Champaign and University of Illinois police departments are investigating a sexual assault that occurred Oct. 28 in the 200 block of East Green Street, Champaign (near Boneyard Creek).<br/><br/>The victim was walking eastbound at about 3 a.m. on the north sidewalk in the 100 block of East Green Street. As the victim approached Second Street, the offender approached the victim and asked where she was going. The victim ignored the offender and continued east. As the victim crossed Second Street, she was grabbed from behind and dragged to the north side of the apartment building at 202 E. Green St. (at the northeast corner of Second and Green streets). The victim was then sexually assaulted in the grass near the creek. Following the sexual assault, the offender ran westbound on the sidewalk along the south side of the Boneyard Creek toward First Street.<br/><br/>OFFENDER DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>The offender is described as a black male of medium complexion and in his early 20s, with very short black hair. He was clean-shaven and of muscular build. He was wearing a charcoal gray hoodie and dark jeans.<br/><br/>Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing or unusual characteristics. Racial descriptions do not, by themselves, offer a meaningful picture of an individual&#39;s appearance. <br/><br/>POLICE RESPONSE:<br/><br/>The Champaign and University of Illinois police are working to identify and apprehend the offender in this incident. Witnesses to this event or those with information are encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216 or the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545.<br/><br/>SAFETY INFORMATION:<br/><br/>Members of the campus community are strongly encouraged to follow these safety tips to decrease their potential for becoming a victim:<br/><br/>&#39; Stay alert &#39; call the police immediately to report suspicious activity and/or if this subject is observed.<br/><br/>&#39; Trust your instincts &#39; if it does not feel right, call for help.<br/><br/>&#39; Avoid walking alone at night. Travel in groups when possible and always walk in well-lit, heavily traveled areas.<br/><br/>&#39; Turn down your electronic devices. Excessive volume or use of electronic devices (iPods, PDAs, cellphones, etc.) can distract you from potential safety hazards.<br/><br/>&#39; If you choose to consume alcohol, please drink moderately &#39; remember your ability to respond is diminished by over-consumption of alcohol.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:<br/><br/>The University of Illinois, Champaign and Urbana police departments are collaborating to provide CrimeReports, a national crime mapping service, with up-to-date crime information.
