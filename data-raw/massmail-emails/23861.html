                <div style="min-height:360px;line-height:16px;"> Dear Colleagues:<br/><br/>We are truly appreciative of your tireless efforts in bringing about a successful conclusion to the Brilliant Futures Campaign. The Urbana-Champaign campus received commitments and gifts totaling more than $1.671 billion; the entire campaign&#39;s final total was $2.43 billion. Each and every faculty and staff member should be recognized for their dedication and effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to put some things in perspective. The total for the last campaign that ended in 2000 by all three UI campuses was $1.53 billion. We raised $141 million more than all three campuses combined. And you did it! <br/><br/>The Brilliant Futures Campaign is the largest in University history and one of the most ambitious in the history of higher education in the country. Currently there have been approximately 20 capital campaigns with a goal of more than $2 billion. <br/><br/>We had many different highlights during the campaign. A couple that stands out is that we have commitments for 70 new funds for named chairs and professorships and 1,246 new funds for fellowships and scholarships. Outstanding faculty members are the magnets that attract incredible students to our campus. Also more than 9,300 current and former faculty and staff members contributed during the campaign. <br/><br/>When we reflect back on the campaign what stood out for us was the way that you were able to expertly match the passions of our donors with the ambitions of our mission. We know that in many important ways you are the front door to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Campaign. You are the face of the campus. Critical to our success during Brilliant Futures was the way you conducted yourselves, the way you communicated our message, and the way that you engaged the prospective donors. You did all of this with a level of professionalism and creativity that goes beyond anything that we have ever witnessed in the past. No wonder we met and exceeded our goal.<br/><br/>So as we celebrate this great accomplishment let us celebrate your tireless dedication, your commitment to excellence, the sacrifices you made to your own personal time, the miles you logged, the countless hours researching donors and drafting proposal, your teamwork, and most of all your passion to Illinois. Thank you for making the Brilliant Futures Campaign the most successful in the history of this great university. Thank you! <br/><br/>With sincere gratitude,<br/><br/>Phyllis M. Wise<br/>Vice President, University of Illinois<br/>Chancellor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign <br/><br/>Sidney S. Micek<br/>President<br/>University of Illinois Foundation </div>
