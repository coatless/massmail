Wright Street, Champaign<br/><br/>BRIEF DETAILS:<br/><br/>The Champaign Police Department is investigating an armed robbery that occurred at 201 S. Wright Street, Champaign.<br/><br/>On Monday, December 3rd at approximately 12:10 AM, an individual was entering his apartment building in the 200 block of South Wright Street when he was approached by the offender who asked for money.&nbsp;&nbsp;The offender punched the victim in the mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;The offender inferred that he had a gun or a knife and took the victim&#39;s wallet.&nbsp;&nbsp;The offender left the area northbound on foot.<br/><br/>OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:<br/><br/>The offender is described as a clean shaven, black male with a dark complexion, early 20&#39;s, 5&#39;8&#39; tall, 150-160 pounds with short hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the incident, the offender was wearing a white short sleeve tee shirt and blue jeans.<br/><br/>Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing or unusual characteristics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Racial descriptions do not, by themselves, offer a meaningful picture of an individual&#39;s appearance. <br/><br/>POLICE RESPONSE:<br/><br/>The Champaign and University of Illinois Police Departments are working together to identify and apprehend the offender.&nbsp;&nbsp;Witnesses to this event or those with information are encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 351-4545 or Crime Stoppers at 373-TIPS (8477).<br/><br/>SAFETY INFORMATION:<br/><br/>Members of the campus community are strongly encouraged to follow these safety tips to decrease their potential for becoming a victim:<br/><br/>-Stay alert - call the police immediately to report suspicious activity and/or if this subject is observed.<br/><br/>-Trust your instincts - if it does not feel right, call for help.<br/><br/>-Avoid walking alone at night. Travel in groups when possible and always walk in well-lit, heavily traveled areas. <br/><br/>-Turn down your electronic devices. Excessive volume or use of electronic devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones, etc.) can distract you from potential safety hazards.<br/><br/>-If you choose to consume alcohol, please drink moderately - remember your ability to respond is diminished by over-consumption of alcohol.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:<br/><br/>The University of Illinois, Champaign and Urbana Police Departments are collaborating to provide CrimeReports, a national crime mapping service, with up-to-date crime information.
