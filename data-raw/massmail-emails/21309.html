                <div style="min-height:360px;line-height:16px;"> Dear Colleagues:<br/> <br/>President Hogan recently announced that the University has begun an analysis of University and campus policies related to sexual harassment, sexual abuse, and related misconduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a component of this analysis, the President has requested that each campus provide an online education program to its faculty and staff.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/> <br/>In response, our campus has decided to use the I-Initiative:&nbsp;&nbsp;the Workplace Harassment and Discrimination Prevention Education Initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp;The I-Initiative is a broad-based course that addresses not only sexual harassment and gender-based actions, but also other forms of discrimination, harassment, and inappropriate conduct based on race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, and other characteristics.&nbsp;&nbsp;This initiative strengthens the University&#39;s commitment to educating faculty and staff on methods to prevent, identify, address, and properly report misconduct in our unique University setting.<br/> <br/>The initiative will be implemented in several phases over the next few months.&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of their leadership commitment to a safe and welcoming living, learning, and working environment, deans, directors, and department heads will be the first group to take the course throughout the month of March.&nbsp;&nbsp;The gradual roll out will continue through the spring, summer, and early fall for all faculty and staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your unit head will notify you when it is time for your unit to complete the course.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken the course and I strongly believe that as an institution we will be strengthened by our collective commitment to ensuring a workplace free of discrimination and harassment.<br/> <br/>If you have any questions about the I-Initiative, please contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access at 333-0885 or oeoa@illinois.edu.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/> <br/>Thank you for your efforts in making our campus a welcoming and safe place for every member of our community.<br/> <br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Phyllis M. Wise<br/>Vice President, University of Illinois<br/>Chancellor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign </div>
