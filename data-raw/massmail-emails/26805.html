Travel in groups when possible and always walk in well-lit, heavily traveled areas. <br/><br/>-Turn down your electronic devices. Excessive volume or use of electronic devices (iPods, PDAs, cell phones, etc.) can distract you from potential safety hazards.<br/><br/>-If you choose to consume alcohol, please drink moderately - remember your ability to respond is diminished by over-consumption of alcohol.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:<br/><br/>The University of Illinois, Champaign and Urbana Police Departments are collaborating to provide CrimeReports, a national crime mapping service, with up-to-date crime information.
