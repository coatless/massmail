                <div style="min-height:360px;line-height:18px;"> The 1966 AAUP Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities, developed in concert with the American Council on Education (ACE) and the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges (AGB), states that &quot;The variety and complexity of the tasks performed by institutions of higher education produce an inescapable interdependence among governing board, administration, faculty, students, and others. The relationship calls for adequate communication among these components, and full opportunity for appropriate joint planning and effort.&quot; (<a href="http://www.aaup.org/report/1966-statement-government-colleges-and-universities">http://www.aaup.org/report/1966-statement-government-colleges-and-universities</a>)<br/> <br/>The Senate of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign is committed to fostering the conditions that make such joint decision-making effective. However, these processes exist not only at the campus and university levels. They are also implemented - and for most faculty most directly experienced - at the department and college levels. Therefore, the Senate is conducting a general survey of shared governance processes within departments and colleges. These questions are loosely adapted from a similar survey developed by the AAUP.<br/> <br/>This survey is confidential: your identity and that of your department and college are protected.<br/> <br/>If survey results indicate that further, more detailed inquiry is justified, we recommend that the Senate Executive Committee work with the Office of the Provost to develop a follow-up process that would identify particular units and outline steps for improvement where needed.<br/><br/>The survey has ten items and takes only a few minutes to complete. The closing date for submission of a survey is April 26, 2013.
