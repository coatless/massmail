                <div style="min-height:360px;line-height:16px;"> March 23, 2012<br/><br/>Dear Colleagues:<br/><br/>Today begins a new chapter in the history of the University of Illinois. As you know, President Michael Hogan has resigned effective July 1, 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you will join me in thanking Dr. Hogan for his service on behalf of the University.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, I want to express my personal appreciation to Dr. Hogan for appointing me chancellor of this great university and to him and Virginia, for their many acts of kindness toward Dick and me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Hogan&#39;s pride in the University was always evident and his goal was one that we shared: to make the University better.<br/><br/>Until July 1, Dr. Robert A. Easter will be president-designate. On July 1, Dr. Easter will become president for at least two years. As interim chancellor, and someone who has been on this campus for almost four decades, Dr. Easter was instrumental in my smooth transition to chancellor. We first met in China last summer, but I was already well aware of his stellar reputation both as a renowned and respected researcher and as an effective administrator who can make tough decisions in a humane and fair manner. The high level of integrity for which he is known is beyond reproach. The excellent reputation Dr. Easter has earned on our campus and in the broader national and international higher education arena is one that will serve all three campuses well as we move forward. I am very confident Dr. Easter will be an outstanding president.<br/><br/>We share in our setbacks. Let us work together to create a future in which the highest ethical standards guide our every move, in which our stakeholders can look to us with pride as we help shape the lives of young women and men, preparing them for a chance at the American Dream through learning, discovery, and outreach.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leadership changes are critical in any organization but the future of this campus ultimately belongs to each and every one of us, including faculty, students, support staff, administrative professionals, deans, and directors. We share in our successes. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Phyllis M. Wise<br/>Vice President, University of Illinois<br/>Chancellor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign </div>
