<p>This email message applies to anyone who is or has been an employee of the University of Illinois during tax year 2013. If you were NOT an employee during tax year 2013, please disregard this message.</p>
<p>If you are a Foreign National (nonresident alien), who is or has been a University employee during tax year 2013, you may now receive your 1042-S tax form electronically.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wish to receive your Form 1042-S electronically, you must provide consent using the NESSIE application through January 15, 2014 @ 10:59 P.M.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructions for consenting are provided under section 2 (Consent Process for Electronic Access).</p>
<p>If you do not consent to receive your tax Form W-2 and/or 1042-S electronically, the form will be mailed to you as in previous years. However, there is an important mailing address requirement that also applies to you. Please refer to section 3 (Address Requirement for Mailing of Forms).</p>
<p>&nbsp;**********************************************</p>
<p>Below is important information that will help you with end-of-year processing of the Statement of Wages (IRS Form W-2).</p>

<p>==========================================</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. ELECTRONIC PROCESS FOR FORM W-2 &amp; 1042-S</p>
<p>===========================================</p>
<p>Again this year the University is pleased to offer the option of accessing your Form W-2 electronically and, for the first time, Form 1042-S. Last year over 40,000 employees chose to receive their W-2 electronically. The consent process for calendar year 2013 is open through January 15, 2014 @ 10:59 P.M.</p>
<p>If You Previously Consented:</p>
<p>You do not need to provide consent again this year to retrieve your 2013 Form W-2 electronically, if you previously consented and this is the only tax form you will be receiving. You will receive a notification from University Payroll during the third week of January, indicating that your Form W-2 is available online and giving you instructions on how to access it.</p>
<p>If You Are a Foreign National (Non-Resident Alien) Employee:</p>
<p>You do not need to provide consent again this year to retrieve your 2013 Form W-2 and/or 1042-S electronically, if you previously consented for <strong>both</strong> documents. If you previously consented to receive only your Form W-2 electronically, you will need to consent again for access to your Form 1042-S.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will receive a notification from University Payroll during the third week of January, indicating that your Form W-2 and/or 1042-S is available online and giving you instructions on how to access it.</p>
<p>If You Wish to Receive Your W-2 Electronically:</p>
<p>If you have not previously agreed to have your information sent electronically, you can provide consent at any time through January 15, 2014 @ 10:59 P.M.&nbsp;&nbsp;See section 2 (Consent Process for Electronic Access) below for details.</p>
<p>If you DO NOT consent to receive your W-2 or 1042-S electronically by January 15, 2014 @ 10:59 P.M., you will receive a printed Form W-2 and/or 1042-S by regular mail.</p>
<p>Benefits of accessing your Form W-2 and 1042-S online include:</p>
<p>*You will have access to your Form W-2 and 1042-S at least two weeks earlier than the distribution of mailed copies.</p>
<p>*Your Form W-2 and 1042-S is always available to you for secure, convenient and timely access.</p>
<p>*Because you are retrieving your Form W-2 and 1042-S electronically from a secured website, you need not worry that the form will be lost in the mail or stolen from your mailbox and used for identity theft.</p>
<p>*Duplicates are just a few clicks away, even as late as April 14 or 15.</p>
<p>=============================================</p>
<p>2. CONSENT PROCESS FOR ELECTRONIC ACCESS</p>
<p>=============================================</p>
<p>If you wish to receive your Form W-2 and 1042-S electronically, you must provide consent using the NESSIE application through January 15, 2014 @ 10:59 P.M., by following the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Go to NESSIE at <a href="https://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/cf/index.cfm">https://nessie.uihr.uillinois.edu/cf/index.cfm</a></p>
<p>2. Select the 'Compensation' tab.</p>
<p>3. Click the link 'W-2/1042-S Tax Statement.'</p>
<p>4. Click 'Continue.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Log in using your NetID and password.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Enter your Personal Identification Number (PIN) or create one.</p>
<p>7. Once you are on the W-2/1042-S Tax Statement Consent Form page, click 'Continue.'</p>
<p>8. On the Online Tax Forms page, click 'Consent/Withdraw Consent' to reach instructions.</p>
<p>9. Follow the instructions at the bottom of the form to provide consent:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; (2) Enter the consent code. (Click on the consent code link to retrieve the code. This is necessary since it mimics the&nbsp;&nbsp; functionality&nbsp;used to retrieve the W-2 and 1042-S electronically.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; (3) Enter the email address you want your notification regarding retrieval of your Form W-2 and 1042-S to be addressed to. This does not need to be your University email.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; (4) Re-enter your email address.</p>
<p>10. Click the 'Consent' button.</p>
<p>After you submit this information, you will receive an email from the University of Illinois indicating you have consented to receive your W-2 and/or 1042-S electronically.</p>

<p>If you DO NOT follow the steps above and do not consent to receive your Form W-2 or 1042-S electronically by January 15, 2014 @ 10:59 P.M., your Form W-2 and/or 1042-S will be mailed on January 31, 2014 to the mailing address listed on NESSIE as of December 31, 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>=============================================</p>
<p>3. ADDRESS REQUIREMENT FOR MAILING OF FORMS</p>
<p>=============================================</p>
<p>The University of Illinois contracts the services of JAT Software for the annual mailing of Form W-2 and Form 1042-S (for Foreign Nationals).Form W-2 and Form 1042-S will be mailed to the &ldquo;mailing address&rdquo; listed on the employee's Personal Information tab in NESSIE as of December 31, 2013.</p>
<p>If you do not have an active mailing address, the form(s) will be sent to your listed home/permanent address.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Form W-2/1042-S cannot be 'forwarded' in the event the mailing address is incorrect, and will be returned to the UPB office.For Form W-2 and Form 1042-S mailing purposes, you can change your mailing address in NESSIE until December 31, 2013 (see section 4, Additional Information to find address change instructions).</p>
