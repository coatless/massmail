                <div style="min-height:360px;line-height:18px;"> We thank everyone for their patience and cooperation during our work against the phishing attacks on our campus. Instead of sending daily mass mail updates, we will be updating the illinois.edu website accordingly, and we will send any major updates via email to campus as they unfold. <br/><br/>The initial phishing attacks caused the University of Illinois to be placed on the blacklists of several email filtering services. Any company or university using these filtering services could not receive email from @illinois.edu addresses while the University of Illinois was blacklisted. As a note, if you do send an email to a company or university that is using an email filtering service that has us currently blacklisted, you will receive notice that your email did not reach its intended destination.<br/><br/>The efforts of CITES and email users at the University have yielded successes in getting removed from many of these blacklists. <br/><br/>What we are doing to address this serious issue:<br/><br/>- CITES has added extra automated reviews of outgoing email to double check that Illinois email accounts are not being used to send spam. As a matter of necessity, these additional reviews of outgoing email can sometimes delay the delivery of messages. Typical delays have not exceeded 30 minutes.<br/>- We are contacting users of compromised accounts and requiring them to reset their passwords.<br/><br/>What you can do to protect your account:<br/><br/>- Change your @illinois.edu email password to improve your account&#39;s security and help protect that of others. Passwords can be changed by using the CITES Password Manager located at: <a href="http://passwords.cites.illinois.edu">http://passwords.cites.illinois.edu</a><br/>- Continue to check the CITES web site for more information about the phishing attacks and the state of our email service. <br/><br/>We thank you all for your understanding and your continued efforts to help keep our Illinois account information secure.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Greg Gulick, Deputy CIO, University of Illinois, Urbana/Champaign and Executive Director, CITES<br/>Mike Corn, Chief Security Officer, University of Illinois, Urbana/Champaign </div>
